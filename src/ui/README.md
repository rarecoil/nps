# NPS Workflow UI

I put this piece of hot trash together simply so I could work through the bugs
NPS was finding quickly. This whole folder is subject to change to a much more
sophisticated UI as soon as the underlying scanner infrastructure changes.

The current NPS UI is 1. bad and 2. completely insecure. It is meant to work
locally only. There is no authentication support.
